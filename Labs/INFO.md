# What do I do here?

## Defining

1. Rename the folders in this section to:

   - change `Lens` to `lens-for-the-internet`
   - change `Bot` to `autonomous-artistic-agent`
   - change `3` to `being-there-together`
   - change `4` to `endless-source`

## Calling

Have you already started working on `Lab 1`?

1. YES
   - add _ALL_ that content to your new `lens-for-the-internet` folder
     - follow the format that exists here already
       - place your icon images in the `img/` folder
     - if you have multiple `.js` files:
       - make a new folder `js/`
       - move your `JavaScript` files into `js/`
       - (you might need to update your documents to reflect the new directory structure)
         - oh well. Git happens.

2. NO
   - if no (_you should probably start_)
     - use your new `lens-for-the-internet` folder to maintain your code
